Hello! This is my personal website!

NOTE: 
- Repository contains (duplicate) website in folder 'personal-website', which uses React and Vite. It works with a local host
- GitHub pages website uses index.html (outside of 'personal-website') as source file

I chose an MIT LICENSE, because I am okay with others using my website code with credit as it the website pretty simple in the first place and there is not much to branch off of. In addition to this, the license is simple for me to understand the rights, which is a nice plus.
